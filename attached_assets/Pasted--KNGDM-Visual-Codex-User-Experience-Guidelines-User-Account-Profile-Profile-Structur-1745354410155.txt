- Error messages are clear and provide recovery paths
- Time-sensitive actions include extension options

### Specific Accommodations
- Screen reader optimized navigation
- Reduced motion option in preferences
- Text size adjustment controls
- High contrast mode option
- Voice command support (where browser supported)
- Keyboard shortcuts with visual overlay (press and hold Alt)
